## 🚀 About This Repository

Kattis is a well-known platform used by universities and programming competitions like ICPC.  
It focuses on **algorithmic thinking**, **efficient coding**, and **input/output precision**.  
This repository serves as both:
- My personal record of problem-solving progress.
- A reference for others learning algorithms and competitive programming.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Data Structures (Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Geometry and Math Problems
- String Manipulation

## 🏅 Goals

- Strengthen algorithmic thinking and efficiency.  
- Prepare for competitive programming contests.  
- Build a clean and reusable library of solutions.  
- Learn from mistakes and explore multiple approaches.
